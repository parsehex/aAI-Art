# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

You'll need a few things before we start:

- **Ollama** or **OpenRouter API key** to generate new sprites, otherwise you can view existing/preset sprites.

## Making Your First Sprite

1. [Go to the app](https://parsehex.github.io/aAI-Art/) and look for the prompt box.
2. Type something you'd like to see.
3. Choose an AI Provider + Model and hit **Generate**.
4. Wait for the sprite to be generated.

## Troubleshooting

- **"It looks like a mess!"**: Only some models are good at this, in my experience. Try a different model -- the bigger the better.
- **"Nothing is happening"**: Check your console for errors. Ensure your local LLM server is running if you're using one or that you have a valid API key.
